--You see a zed clawing at the window from the backseat, broken nails smearing blood along them. The [criminal divider thingy] is keeping the zed back, and the zed probably wouldn’t be able to reach anyone searching the front seats.
--The other member says we shouldn’t risk it for weapons that might not even be there, and that instead we should be more focused on food and finding a secure area for nightime, which is about 3 hours away. What do you do?

	#(1.1.2.1.2)Take the leader's side

They say the group has stayed here for too long and they should move on and look for food, and that you and the group listening to the leader is going to end badly. The leader slams the [slim jim] against the car, setting off the alarm, and lunges at the other group member.
