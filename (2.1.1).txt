*comment (2.1.1)


--The leader doesn’t take being told what to do too lightly. He turns on you, shouting about he’s the leader or something like that.
--The rest of your group members come out of the house at that moment, carrying a little food, but not enough to satisfy everyone. The leader shouts they should’ve looked harder, that’s hardly enough for one person—
--Group member chips in that the only reason he’s the leader is because he would throw a hissy fit otherwise.
--The leader is nearing his breaking point. The way he looks at the group member and the white-knuckled grip he had on the slim jim don’t bode well with you.
