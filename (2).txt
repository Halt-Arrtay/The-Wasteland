--As the leader works on the lock [i need to research how people break into cars], mentioned he used to work in the repair business and people getting locked out was a common occurrence.
--A thump from inside the car is heard.
--A zed is in the backseat and has seen you. It’s shrieks are muffled, and it’s broken rotting nails leave blood streaks on the glass [would the group have noticed blood inside the window before they started on the car?]
--the zed is cut of from the front row with the divider in police cars, so if you did break in you should be safe.

*choice
	#(2.1)Keep working on the car
		You keep working on the on the car [need to research], ignoring the zed shrieking at you, but your group member who is standing guard angrily asks why you’re still trying to break in with the zed there.

	#(2.2)Give up on car and go search the house
		You packed up your gear and start to head towards the house to help the others, but the leader growls out “where do you think you’re going”.
