The silence was deafening in the neighborhood, the only sound was a solitary plastic bag blowing about in the soft breeze.  

Group of 5 and you sneak down the middle of road, everyone on high guard

It’s been 4 months since apocalypse started

The group consists of leader, and

You have a Saxe knife and a M9A3 Beretta, but it only has 4 shots left
	                  
The group is low on food and ammo

There’s a leader in the group (harsh and short-tempered) directs the group to a house with an old police car on the driveway

”might be weapons in it” 

Some in the group want to split up and search the house (bungalow) while some want to stay and try to break into the car
