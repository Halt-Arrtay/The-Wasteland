	#(1.1.2.1)Try to resolve their conflict
		You step between the two angry members and ask what is wrong. One member screams that the leader is being an idiot trying to open a car looking for weapons when there’s a zed inside the car. The leader screams back that the member is the idiot because the zed is in the backseat and the divider keeps it locked away.
